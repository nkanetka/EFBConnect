# EFB Connect
A utility that shares Microsoft Flight Simulator position, attitude, and traffic information with ForeFlight.

## Compatibility
EFB Connect is compatible with Microsoft Flight Simulator X, Microsoft ESP, and Lockheed Martin Prepar3D.  EFB Connect sends UDP packets on port 49002 as described in the [ForeFlight - Simulator GPS, Traffic, Attitude Integration](https://www.foreflight.com/support/network-gps/) documentation and should be compatible with ForeFlight v5.2 and newer.

## Prerequisites
EFB Connect targets the [.NET Framework 4.5](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42643) and has no other prerequisites.  EFB Connect uses Tim Gregson's Managed SimConnect SDK and does not require FSUIPC. To download the SimConnect DLL (required to build the program), click [here](https://onedrive.live.com/download?resid=B48B0194C5456F5%21353).

## Usage
To begin using EFB Connect, simply launch the program's executable while Flight Simulator is running.  EFB Connect will establish a SimConnect connection upon launch and begin broadcasting data immediately.

As an alternative to using a UDP broadcast, there is an option to select your device's IP address to only send packets to a single device.
